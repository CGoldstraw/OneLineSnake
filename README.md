# OneLineSnake
An implementation of the snake game in Python whilst only using a single line of code (and a 2 line version with significantly less characters)

Both of these files need to be run on Python 3.8 or above due to the assignment operator `:=`. This allows me to change / initialise variables in the while loop that continues the program, which allowed me to fit it on one line.

The Snake game has WASD controls which you enter one character at a time through `input()`. You die if you go into the walls or into yourself.

The only known issue is the fact that the apple will take one more move than expected to display on the board.

## Character Amounts
##### One Line Snake = 343 Characters
##### Two Line Snake = 264 Characters
